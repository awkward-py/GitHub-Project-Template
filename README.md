### GitHub Project Template: Simple JavaScript Stack

This GitHub project template provides a basic structure for a web application using JavaScript for both frontend and backend. The project is split into frontend (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and backend (Node.js with Express). Follow these steps to set up and push the project to your GitHub repository.

#### Frontend:

1. **index.html:**
   - The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
   - Links to `styles.css` for styling and `app.js` for JavaScript functionality.

2. **styles.css:**
   - Basic styles for the webpage, such as setting the font and text alignment.

3. **app.js:**
   - JavaScript file for dynamic content on the webpage.
   - Updates the content of the `h1` element when the DOM is loaded.

#### Backend:

1. **server.js:**
   - The Node.js file using the Express framework to set up a simple server.
   - Defines a single endpoint ('/') that responds with 'Hello from the server!' when accessed.

#### GitHub Setup:

1. **Initialize Git:**
   - Run `git init` to initialize a new Git repository.

2. **Create .gitignore:**
   - Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules` and other unnecessary files from version control.

   ```plaintext
   node_modules/
   ```

3. **Create README.md:**
   - Add a README file to provide information about the project.

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Link the local repository to the remote repository using `git remote add origin <repository_url>`.
   - Push the code to GitHub:

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git push -u origin master
     ```

#### Usage:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/awkward-py/GitHub-Project-Template
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.

#### Considerations:

- Customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to fit your project requirements.
- Extend the backend to include additional routes, database connections, and other functionalities.
- Implement security measures, especially when dealing with sensitive data.
- Follow best practices for version control and documentation.

This template serves as a starting point for a simple web application, and you can build upon it by adding more features, refining the UI, and incorporating additional technologies as needed for your project.
